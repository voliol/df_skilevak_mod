This is the skilevak mod I planned to make for [the "Creatures of the Night" Dwarf Fortress mod jam](https://itch.io/jam/creatures-of-the-night).Well, made, but only partially. Ran out of time I could personally put towards modding, before the mod itself was finished. **Feel free to pick it up!**

The main part that needs doing is implementing more possible skilevak powers in `scripts/skilevak_powers.lua`. There are also some other TODOs that are bonuses, really. Also graphics would be the cherry on top, if you are a sprite artist. Feel free to rename things to not have "voliol" all over them, if you pick it up :). 

And most importantly: have fun!
